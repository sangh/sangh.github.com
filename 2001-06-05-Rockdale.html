This was after someone had mentioned an expose on Rockdale about an breakout of syphilis in a great number of high school students. (The expose talked about parties and the lewd and lascivious social scene in the “safe” far suburbs).</p> <p>Okay so there were two guys with shopping carts walking around a super WalMart, minding their own business, when they bumped carts. No one was hurt and nothing was damaged, but they couldn’t agree on whose fault it was. So, they decided to settle it in a more mature way: a duel. Apparently the terms of the duel weren’t clear to both parties because one went out to his truck and got a tire iron and the other one shot him in the face.</p> </article> <footer> <ul> <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li> <li><a rel="license" href="LICENSE.txt"> Licensed under <img alt="Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License" src="LICENSE.png"></a></li> <li><a href="2011-03-03-p1-1st.html">Next&nbsp;&gt;</a></li> </ul> </footer> </body> </html>
