iOS RSS Reader/Client I Don't Have to Write
===========================================

For a long time after (kind of) being forced to use an iPhone I still hadn't
found an RSS reader app that did everything I wanted.  I don't think I was
being unreasonable and was continually surprised I could not find one (and
wasted many hours trying them all).  Generally I've found iOS apps
to be higher quality than their Android counterparts but several apps I want
just do not exist for the iPhone (even though they do on Android), and an RSS
client without hideous shortcomings _used_ to be one of them.

Off the top of my head I want the RSS client to:

*  Sync to only my Tiny Tiny RSS server instead of connecting to the feeds I'm
   following directly.
*  Keep articles on the phone (can function without any network access).
*  Be able to sync only on WiFi and not use any cell data.
*  Be able to zoom in and pan on images.
*  Be able to zoom out on images (some clients display images at full
   resolution which often means that they extend way way out to the right of
   the text meaning that you have to scroll right and left to see them, which
   means you will accidentally go to the next/previous article.
*  Be able to display the title text of images.
*  Use Safari view because so so many elements are missing and most of the
   readers give you no indication at all that they are missing things.

Anyway, I'm writing this article to basically say *FINALLY*.  I recently found
out that [Fiery Feeds](http://cocoacake.net/apps/fiery/ "Fiery Feeds' home page.")
does everything I want and does it loads better than I ever could have if I
did ever manage to scrape together my own shitty little app.
