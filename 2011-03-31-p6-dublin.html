It reminded me what having friends (that actually want me around) is like. I was also done with the obligations and could just relax until I got home. I stayed with a friend and got to hang out with many of the people they knew and saw Dublin in a very not-touristy and casual way, which means I toured the Google office and a bunch of local bars (was wonderful).</p> <p>Even though the drizzly foggy thing was in full force, Dublin looks pretty cool, I can see where the stereotype of the stone/brick and moss thing comes from. There’s several canals that wind their way through the city and basically provide a park and landmarks. They are aesthetically comfortable and calm for reasons I don’t understand.</p> <p>So all the younger people I met (about a dozen or so) spoke Irish, and when asked they didn’t say “We were taught it in school.” or mention any sort of pressure to learn it, they all said something along the lines of “My friends and I thought it was important to learn it”. It’s fascinating in that I can’t imagine how that sort of meme gets started.</p> </article> <footer> <ul> <li><a href="2011-03-21-p5-england.html">&lt;&nbsp;Previous</a></li> <li><a href="nocomments.html">No Comments?</a></li> <li><a rel="license" href="LICENSE.txt"> Licensed under <img alt="Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License" src="LICENSE.png"></a></li> <li><a href="2011-04-05-p7-n-america.html">Next&nbsp;&gt;</a></li> </ul> </footer> </body> </html>
