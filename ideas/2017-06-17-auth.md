Passwords Are Awful
===================

Passwords are terrible, they are either easy to remember or easy to
brute-force, no one can remember them so they re-use then across many sites,
and they require a whole other authentication system to reset them when they
are (inevitably) forgotten.  Password managers have mitigated many of these,
and everyone should be using them, and 2 factor auth has helped the stealing
of reused usernames and passwords, but they persist.

When passwords need to be reset the most popular reset choice is to send an
email.  This means that if the email is compromised, so is the site!

Doesn't matter what the password is.

So, why don't we just skip the password and send a one-time link to the users
email.  They click it, it opens in whatever browser, and then that browser is
logged in.  Users are okay cutting and pasting to another browser and have
email on their phones, right?

There are some other considerations.  You need a check box if they are using a
public computer, you need to expire each session, and you need a way to list
and close/log-out running sessions.  That is along with all the normal logging
and auth considerations of using a session cookie.
