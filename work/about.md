About
=====

This site is my lame attempt at a blog.  I do not post often and don't want to
feel like I have to keep up with comments.  It seems like if you have comments
you either need to filter and respond to them quickly or try and implement an
automatic spam filtering solution (which never works well).  So I don't have
them.

If there are errors or you want to contact me you can do so through [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/sangh/sangh.github.io/issues).
