Where Are the Comments?
=======================

This site is my lame attempt at a blog.  I do not post often and don't want to
feel like I have to keep up with comments.  It seems like the only way to stop
them devolving into attacks on each other is to hand-filter and respond
quickly or implement automatic spam filtering (which never works well).  So I
don't have them.

If there are errors or you want to contact me you can do so through [GitHub
Issues](https://github.com/sangh/sangh.github.io/issues).
